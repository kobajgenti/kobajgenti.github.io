# About Me

My name is Koba JGENTI. I'm from Georgia (Not the state :D).

### @ BU
I’m a senior year Computer Science major with a minor in Economics. 

### Outside of BU 
Outside of school, I run a tech company – KJ Group – back home which I founded. 

We currently have two apps on the market:
* [Borbalo ](https://borbalo.ge), which has over 100,000 monthly users; 
* [VEF](https://apps.apple.com/ge/app/vefxistyaosani/id1494639788), with over 150,000 users yearly.

The apps are consistently in Top 100 Apps in Georgia and time to time rank in Top 10.
