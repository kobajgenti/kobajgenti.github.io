## CEO @ KJ Group • 2018 - Present

<img src="_work/kj_group_logo.png" alt="KJ Group Logo" width="150">

I founded KJ Group in 2018 and have been running it ever since.

> Fun fact: I was not old enough to legally register as CEO in 2018. So technically speaking, my dad was the owner and CEO for the first few years.

The company now has over 15 employees, mostly working remotely around the world. They are predominantly based in Georgia, Belarus, Poland, and Cyprus. As of now (2024), we have two apps on the Georgian market.

Fifteen employees sounds like a lot, at least for me, but it is not quite enough to have a person assigned to every task that needs to be done in the company. So right now, I’m still filling in all the roles, which is still a huge progress from answering customer support calls.

My goal is to have at least 50 employees in the near future.
