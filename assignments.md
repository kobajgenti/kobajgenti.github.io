# My Assignments

## Assignment α

In this assignment, I developed and published a website for the first time in my life. Granted, I was referencing the professor’s code a lot and used a super easy-to-use template. But I find it very cool.

## Assignment 0

I created this dummy assignment which asks for two input numbers and print out the sum.

## Assignment 1

I analyzed elevator data according to assignment 1 requirments on Google Colab. For coding mainly I used ChatGPT.

## Assignment 3

I implemented a custom SVD to reduce the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset and trained a logistic regression model on the reduced data. By varying the number of SVD components, I analyzed their impact on accuracy and training time to determine the optimal number.

## Assignment 4

I created a Flask-based LSA search engine that queries newsgroup posts and visualizes results. I adapted the code structure from Assignment 2 to fit this project's specific LSA and search functionality requirements.

## Midterm

I'm submitting my midterm assignment. I implemented several interesting features, including adjective-weighted TF-IDF. I also explored sentiment analysis and investigated how time affects review scores.
While I achieved 88% accuracy during one test run in Google Colab, I unfortunately couldn't replicate these results consistently. The model performed poorly on Kaggle, and I wasn't able to determine the cause of this inconsistency.
I encountered some technical challenges, particularly with processing time. Initially, Google Colab estimated a 40-hour runtime, which was impractical. I resolved this by converting the code to run on my local machine, reducing the processing time to 2 hours.
Although I'm disappointed I couldn't achieve better final results, the assignment was a valuable learning experience in exploring different NLP techniques and handling computational constraints.

## Assignment 6

For this assignment, I implemented the TODOs in a Flask application that demonstrates linear regression assumptions through interactive visualizations, where I coded the data generation, model fitting, and plotting functionality, and modified the HTML template and API endpoint to maintain form values after submission, allowing users to see how different parameters like sample size, mean, variance, and number of simulations affect the regression results and their distributions.

## Assignment 7

For this assignment, I implemented a Flask application that performs statistical inference on linear regression parameters. The app generates simulated data with specified parameters (β₀, β₁, μ, σ²), conducts hypothesis tests, and calculates confidence intervals. I implemented data persistence using session storage, created interactive visualizations for test results and confidence intervals, and added features like p-value calculation and dynamic color-coding based on statistical significance.

## Assignment 8

For this assignment, I visualized how logistic regression parameters change as two data clusters move apart. My visualizations show the decision boundaries and how model parameters evolve with increasing separation.

Note: The explainer video is 3 minutes (sorry for going over the time limit!)

## Assignment 10

In this project, I developed an intuitive web interface for performing image and text-based similarity searches using the COCO dataset and OpenCLIP embeddings. The interface allows users to search using image queries, text queries, or a hybrid approach that combines both, with a clean UI that dynamically adjusts its form fields based on the selected search type and displays results with similarity scores.
