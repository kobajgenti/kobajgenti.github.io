# My Assignments

## Assignment α

In this assignment, I developed and published a website for the first time in my life. Granted, I was referencing the professor’s code a lot and used a super easy-to-use template. But I find it very cool.

## Assignment 0

I created this dummy assignment which asks for two input numbers and print out the sum.

## Assignment 1

I analyzed elevator data according to assignment 1 requirments on Google Colab. For coding mainly I used ChatGPT.

## Assignment 3

I implemented a custom SVD to reduce the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset and trained a logistic regression model on the reduced data. By varying the number of SVD components, I analyzed their impact on accuracy and training time to determine the optimal number.

## Assignment 4

I created a Flask-based LSA search engine that queries newsgroup posts and visualizes results. I adapted the code structure from Assignment 2 to fit this project's specific LSA and search functionality requirements.

## Midterm

I'm submitting my midterm assignment. I implemented several interesting features, including adjective-weighted TF-IDF. I also explored sentiment analysis and investigated how time affects review scores.
While I achieved 88% accuracy during one test run in Google Colab, I unfortunately couldn't replicate these results consistently. The model performed poorly on Kaggle, and I wasn't able to determine the cause of this inconsistency.
I encountered some technical challenges, particularly with processing time. Initially, Google Colab estimated a 40-hour runtime, which was impractical. I resolved this by converting the code to run on my local machine, reducing the processing time to 2 hours.
Although I'm disappointed I couldn't achieve better final results, the assignment was a valuable learning experience in exploring different NLP techniques and handling computational constraints.
