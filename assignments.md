# My Assignments

## Assignment α

In this assignment, I developed and published a website for the first time in my life. Granted, I was referencing the professor’s code a lot and used a super easy-to-use template. But I find it very cool.

## Assignment 3

I implemented a custom SVD to reduce the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset and trained a logistic regression model on the reduced data. By varying the number of SVD components, I analyzed their impact on accuracy and training time to determine the optimal number.

## Assignment 4

I created a Flask-based LSA search engine that queries newsgroup posts and visualizes results. I adapted the code structure from Assignment 2 to fit this project's specific LSA and search functionality requirements.
