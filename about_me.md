# About Me

My name is Koba JGENTI. I'm from Georgia (not the state of Georgia :D).

### @ BU
I’m a senior-year student Computer Science major with a minor in Economics. 

### Outside of BU 
Outside of school, [I run a tech company](/work.md) – KJ Group – back home which I also founded in 2018 (I was 14). 

We currently have two apps on the market the apps are consistently in Top 100 Apps in Georgia and time to time rank in Top 10. Learn more about the apps on [Projects Page](/projects.md).
